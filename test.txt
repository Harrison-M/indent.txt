All you have to do...
    Is create an indented hierarchy
    Of your notes
    In a list
    And Indent.txt will turn it into a nice HTML file
            With a ul hierarchy based on indent levels
    Just use either
        The command line utility
        or the Sublime Text 2 Plugin
It's great for:
    Note-taking
    Outlining
